 *
 * This function will read a line from the open file handle \p fp. This function reads input characters
 * until either a newline character (`\\n`) is found or EOF is reached. A block of memory large enough to hold the read line
 * will be implicitly allocated by the function, and its address placed at the pointer pointed to by \p buf.
 * The length of the aforementioned memory block will be stored in the variable pointed at by \p bufsize.
 *
 * The caller is not expected to allocate memory as that will be automatically done by wget_getline(),
 * but it is responsibility of the caller free the memory allocated by a previous invocation of this function.
 * The caller is also responsible for opening and closing the file to read from.
 *
 * Subsequent calls to wget_getline() that use the same block of memory allocated by previous calls (that is,
 * the caller did not free the buffer returned by a previous call to wget_getline()) will try to reuse as much as possible
 * from the available memory.
 * The block of memory allocated by wget_getline() may be larger than the length of the line read, and might even contain additional lines
 * in it. When wget_getline() returns, the contents of the buffer (pointed at by \p buf) are guaranteed to start with the first
 * character of the last line read, and such line is also guaranteed to end with a NULL termination character (`\0`).
 * The length of the last read line will be returned by wget_getline(), whereas the actual length of the buffer will be placed in the variable
 * pointed at by \p bufsize.
 * The newline character (`\\n`) will not be included in the last read line.

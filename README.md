# GNU Wget2 - Introduction

GNU Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive website downloader.

Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget, that provides the basic
functions needed by a web client.

Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses many features to allow fast operation.

In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to HTTP zlib
compression, parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header.

GNU Wget2 is licensed under GPLv3+.

Libwget is licensed under LGPLv3+.


# Features

A non-exhaustive list of features

- Support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0 protocol

- OCSP stapling + OCSP server querying as a fallback (experimental, needs GnuTLS >= 3.3.11)

- Character encoding of input files may be specified despite from local and remote encoding (--input-encoding)
- Support scanning RSS 2.0 feeds from local files (--force-rss -i <filename>)
- Support scanning RSS 2.0 feeds.
- Support scanning Atom 1.0 feeds from local files (--force-atom -i <filename>)
- Support scanning Atom 1.0 feeds.
- Support scanning URLs from local Sitemap XML file (--force-sitemap -i <filename>)
- Support scanning sitemap files given in robots.txt (Sitemap XML, gzipped Sitemap XML, plain text) including
sitemap index files.

- ICEcast / SHOUTcast support via library (see examples/getstream.c)
- respect /robots.txt "Robot Exclusion Standard" and `<META name="robots" ...>`
- new option --secure-protocol=PFS to have TLS only plus forcing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- IDN support for international domains
- autotools support
- proxy support
- cookies (session/non-session), detection of supercookies via Mozilla Public Suffix List
  (use the new option --cookie-suffixes <filename>, better: put it into ~/.wgetrc)
- recursive download of websites with or without spanning hosts
- download of single web pages / resources
- zlib/gzip compressed HTTP/HTTPS downloads (gzip, deflate)
- number of parallel download threads is adjustable
- include directive for config files (wildcards allowed)
- support for keep-alive connections
- included CSS, HTML, XML parser needed for recursive downloads
- gettext support
- HTTPS via libgnutls
- support for Metalink RFC 6249 (Metalink/HTTP: Mirrors and Hashes)
- support for Metalink RFC 5854 (Metalink Download Description Format / .meta4 files)
- support for Metalink 3
- Metalink checksumming via libgnutls
- DNS lookup cache
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- tested on Debian SID amd64 and OpenBSD 5.0
- compiled and tested with gcc (4.7.1 upto 4.8.2) and clang (3.1.1 upto 3.4)
- tested regularly with static analysis tools
- compiled and linked with hardening options proposed by the Debian project

# Build Requirements

The following packages are needed to build the software

* autotools (autoconf, autogen, automake, autopoint, libtool)
* pkg-config >= 0.28 (recommended)
* doxygen (for creating the documentation)
* gettext >= 0.18.1
* libz >= 1.2.3 (the distribution may call the package zlib*, eg. zlib1g on Debian)
* liblzma >= 5.1.1alpha (optional, if you want HTTP lzma decompression)
* libbz2 >= 1.0.6 (optional, if you want HTTP bzip2 decompression)
* libbrotlidec >= 1.0.0 (optional, if you want HTTP brotli decompression)
* libgnutls >= 2.10.0
* libidn2 >= 0.9 + libunistring >= 0.9.3 (libidn >= 1.25 if you don't have libidn2)
* flex >= 2.5.35
* libpsl >= 0.5.0
* libnghttp2 >= 1.3.0 (optional, if you want HTTP/2 support)

The versions are recommended, but older versions may also work.


# Building from git

Download project and prepare sources with

		git clone git@gitlab.com:gnuwget/wget2.git
		cd wget2
		./bootstrap
		# on shell failure try 'bash ./bootstrap'

Build Wget2 with

		./configure
		make

Test the functionality

		make check

Install Wget2 and libwget

		sudo make install (or su -c "make install")


# Valgrind Testing

To run the test suite with valgrind memcheck

		make check-valgrind

or if you want valgrind memcheck by default

		./configure --enable-valgrind-tests
		make check

To run single tests with valgrind (e.g. test-k)

		cd tests
		VALGRIND_TESTS=1 ./test-k

Why not directly using valgrind like 'valgrind --leak-check=full ./test-k' ?
Well, you want to valgrind 'wget2' and not the test program itself, right ?


# Coverage Report

To generate and view the test code coverage

		make check-coverage
		<browser> lcov/index.html


# Control Flow Integrity with clang

To instrument clang's [CFI](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html):

		CC="clang-5.0" CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=cfi -fno-sanitize-trap=all -fno-sanitize=cfi-icall -flto -fvisibility=hidden" NM=/usr/bin/llvm-nm-5.0 RANLIB=/usr/bin/llvm-ranlib-5.0 AR=/usr/bin/llvm-ar-5.0 LD=/usr/bin/gold ./configure
		make clean
		make check

With clang-5.0 `-fsanitize=cfi-icall` does not work as expected.
Our logger callback functions are typed correctly, but falsely cause a hiccup.

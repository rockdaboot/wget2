# WRONG KEY USAGE: 
# Omit digitalSignature and keyEncipherment.
# Include something irrelevant like non_repudiation.
key_encipherment
# Or simply leave key_usage out entirely if the client requires it,
# but explicitly setting a 'wrong' one is better for testing.

# 2. KEY PURPOSE (Application level)
# This adds the 'Extended Key Usage' (EKU) extension.
# If you omit this, many clients will mark the cert as 'Insecure' 
# or 'Not intended for this use'.
